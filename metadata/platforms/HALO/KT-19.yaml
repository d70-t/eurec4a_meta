      data_description: |
          The Kelvin infrared radiation Thermometer (KT-19, version KT-19.85II) was operated in a nadir- looking configuration 
          within the temperature and pressure stabilized housing of VELOX. It measures brightness temperatures for the wavelength 
          range of 9.6 to 11.5 μm and covers a temperature range between -50 °C and 50 °C. With a sampling frequency of 20 Hz and 
          a FOV of 2.3°, the KT-19 resolves cloud top or surface temperature heterogeneities with an along-track spatial resolution 
          of 400 m (at 10 km flight altitude). The uncertainty is estimated with calibration by the manufacturer and depends on the 
          temperature difference between the instrument housing and the observed scene. For typical conditions during EUREC4A, with 
          cloud top temperatures of 10 °C and a 10 °C temperature in the temperature stabilized housing, the total uncertainty is about 0.5 K.
