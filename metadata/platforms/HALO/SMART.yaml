    data_description: |
        The Spectral Modular Airborne Radiation measurement sysTem (SMART) measures spectral radiances and irradiances 
        from zenith and nadir-oriented sensors \citep{Wendisch_2016, Wendisch_2001a}. During EUREC4A, SMART was limited to 
        measure the spectral, downward irradiance $F^{\downarrow}_\lambda$.

        The spectrometer system of SMART covers the visible and near infrared (300 nm to 2200 nm) wavelength range with a 
        spectral resolution of 2 to 3 nm for wavelengths shorter than 1000 nm and a spectral resolution of 10 to 15 nm for 
        longer wavelengths \citep{Krisna_2018, Wolf_2017}. SMART on HALO utilizes a stabilization platform, which ensures 
        the horizontal alignment of the upper irradiance inlet independently of the aircraft attitude \citep{Wendisch_2001a, Wendisch_2004}. 
        The stabilization is able to correct for roll and pitch angles of up to \mbox{$\pm 6^{\circ}$}. 

        Uncertainties of measured downward irradiance result from the cosine response of the optical inlet and the 
        radiometric calibration of the entire system. The relative deviation from an ideal cosine response is in the 
        range of $\pm 3\,\%$ for most Sun geometries \citep{Wendisch_2001a, Wendisch_2002a, Ehrlich_2009a}. However, 
        for solar zenith angles $\theta_\mathrm{0}$ close to $0^\circ$ (high sun) or $90^\circ$ (sun at the horizon) 
        the deviations from the cosine response increase.

        The radiometric calibration of SMART is performed against a NIST traceable calibration standard. During field-operation, 
        the stability of the radiometric calibration is verified by regular transfer calibrations before each flight. The total 
        measurement uncertainties of $F^{\downarrow }_{\lambda}$ are composed of individual errors by the spectral calibration, 
        the spectrometer noise and dark current, the primary radiometric calibration, and the transfer calibration. For the 
        observation conditions during EUREC4A, the total measurement uncertainty of $F_{\lambda}^{\uparrow \downarrow}$ is 
        about $5.4\, \%$ for the visible and and $8.4\, \%$ for near-infrared wavelength range.
